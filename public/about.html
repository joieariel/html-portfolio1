<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! My name is Joie (Joy) Whitmon and I am a rising sophomore computer science major, with a minor in mathematics at Spelman College.</p>

<p>I am starting my web development journey after failing to secure a summer opportunity. 
  In an effort to learn more skills and make my resume more competitive so I am not in the same position (internship-less) next summer I decided to take this Web Development course.
  In addition, I am still trying to narrow down my career options within the vast tech field. Since I am not doing anything this summer I decided that it would be good to stay busy and try new things, so I will be able to find my technology niche. 
  </p>

<p>Here is my first ever website, 
  which will showcase some of my projects as
   I embark on this new journey. I am so excited 
   to have more projects and gain more experience!
    Enjoy!</p>
